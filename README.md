# StoryboardsRevisited
Examples Shown In Storyboards Revisited Talk from Swift London, Tuesday 25th October

# Branches

## master
Typical Storyboard code implementation with high coupling between storyboard and view controllers

## Storyboards-Revisited-Refactor-Configuration
Major refactoring introducing Visitor pattern to generalise prepare(for segue: sender:) and to move outside of View Controllers

## Storyboards-Revisited-Refactored-Dependancy-Injection
The final implementation with dependancies refactored to be injected at the point of need, removing long chains of dependancies between view controllers.

PR's and thoughts welcome, contributions very welcome.

Thanks
